1. Forest recovery after fire in two cases: when the event is followed by a wet season, and when is followed by an intense- drought season

2. Given the relatively short time span available from LTS for characterizing recovery in a boreal forest context (currently 38 years), the question of whether short-term spectral recovery (i.e., within 5- or 10-years post disturbance) is indicative of long-term recovery outcomes is key. Early indications of recovery could be useful for planning interventions or improving our understanding of the consequences of disturbances. Such an experiment would require ALS or field plot data for calibration and validation."

3. Is the impact of change magnitude on post-disturbance recovery rates modulated by forest type, as has been found in other forest environments (Hislop et al. 2019)?"
